# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix Movies and TV Shows (2008–2021)

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix dataset to uncover patterns in the platform’s content library.

- Top Contributors: Identifying the countries and genres that dominate the Netflix catalog.


Tools Used:

- Language:
Python

- Libraries: 
Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Visualization), NumPy.
